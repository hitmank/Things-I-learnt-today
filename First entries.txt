iOS:
1. ARC and strong retain cycles - short video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcoZJ88d-vM

2. Concurrency and threading in iOS : video :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTcq6L-PaDQ
- Not very good, need to read more about GCD and queue switching.
- How can main (serial) queue be async? Dispatch.main.async{}

Mining:
1. Similar item sets -> k-Shingling, and Jaccard.
2. Min Hashing to reduce size of set
   - Still not clear how Jaccard similarity and min hashing comparison have same prob.
   - must read again. Then proceed to locality sensitive hashing(bands)

- Must read again

1. React for Beginners - https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3776896399&feature=iv&src_vid=PGUMRVowdv8&v=ZnRFerIP8aA
(Prep for hackathon)
- Interesting, have to learn more.

2. Re-read MinHashing.
- Clear about Jaccard and min-hash similarity.
- Will need to re-read the probability calculations before quiz. Most likely source of questions will be choose a appropriate b and r for some threshold.
- Completed Locality sensitive hashing. Clear.

Saturday, 23rd September and Sunday, 24th September

1. ACM Hackathon at USC
-> Used the Google Maps API quite a bit.
-> very easy to use with minimal “Register your app and get key” kind of stuff.
-> More than learning things technically, I learnt more about building a web app in a limited time frame.
-> Need to have server and front end modules at least set up before the event.
-> Need to investigate possible risks at a early stage.
   -Learnt this because of the problem of converting Addresses to LatLong, with googles geocode api which had a limit.
-> Prepare for your demo!!!!
-> Prepare to sleep less

Monday, 25th September.

1. Tutorial on Flask. -> Short, will continue part 2 tomorrow.
2. PCFG’s -> This is for NLP assignment 3. 
	-> Read the basics of CFG and PCFG. Seems simple. Have to complete tomorrow and start on assignment.
	-> Also, brush up on log-log scales for graphs on the assignment.
