iOS:
1. ARC and strong retain cycles - short video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcoZJ88d-vM

2. Concurrency and threading in iOS : video :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTcq6L-PaDQ
- Not very good, need to read more about GCD and queue switching.
- How can main (serial) queue be async? Dispatch.main.async{}

Mining:
1. Similar item sets -> k-Shingling, and Jaccard.
2. Min Hashing to reduce size of set
   - Still not clear how Jaccard similarity and min hashing comparison have same prob.
   - must read again. Then proceed to locality sensitive hashing(bands)

- Must read again

1. React for Beginners - https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3776896399&feature=iv&src_vid=PGUMRVowdv8&v=ZnRFerIP8aA
(Prep for hackathon)
- Interesting, have to learn more.

2. Re-read MinHashing.
- Clear about Jaccard and min-hash similarity.
- Will need to re-read the probability calculations before quiz. Most likely source of questions will be choose a appropriate b and r for some threshold.
- Completed Locality sensitive hashing. Clear.

Saturday, 23rd September and Sunday, 24th September

1. ACM Hackathon at USC
-> Used the Google Maps API quite a bit.
-> very easy to use with minimal “Register your app and get key” kind of stuff.
-> More than learning things technically, I learnt more about building a web app in a limited time frame.
-> Need to have server and front end modules at least set up before the event.
-> Need to investigate possible risks at a early stage.
   -Learnt this because of the problem of converting Addresses to LatLong, with googles geocode api which had a limit.
-> Prepare for your demo!!!!
-> Prepare to sleep less
-> we got a special mention for our idea being very useful or something.

Monday, 25th September.

1. Tutorial on Flask. -> Short, will continue part 2 tomorrow.
2. PCFG’s -> This is for NLP assignment 3. 
	-> Read the basics of CFG and PCFG. Seems simple. Have to complete tomorrow and start on assignment.
	-> Also, brush up on log-log scales for graphs on the assignment.

Thursday, 19th October (Haven’t been updating this for a while)

Brief summary of the last month or so.
1. NLP
	- Learnt and implemented the CYK parser. Good fun working with dynamic programming. Spent a long time (too long) on the back-tracking part to actually get the solution. Shows I didn’t really understand that well enough. 
	- Midterm - a lot of dependency parsing, POS tagging, Viterbi Algorithm, Shift reduce parsers. - Will definately have to revisit for Finals.

2. Data Mining 
	- Implemented the SON algorithm for frequent item sets in Scala and Spark. Good experience. The core algorithm was simple enough, but spent a lot of time on things like writing custom sort for a list of lists. 
	- Had 3 whole classes on Recommender systems. Very well taught and with the weekly quizzes, its been easy to keep up.
	- Now moved onto Clustering and slightly more advanced things. Requires more time.
	- Currently implementing a User-User and Item-Item based Collaborative filtering recommender for assignment 3. - Stuck at imputing values for unknown users/items. - with the current pressure, I just want to beat the baseline defined and submit it.

3.Job search/preparation
-> A lot of rejects, a lot of no replies.
-> Avvo process is ongoing. I am looking at iOS again. Things are flooding back. Confidence is building but need more prep on things I used to know and also many things I used and didn’t understand.
-> General algorithms etc, going pretty slow. Too much to do with NLP and Mining assignments, exams and quizzes.
